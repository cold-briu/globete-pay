# Globete Pay Context

## Description

Pay instantly in Colombia with crypto, via Bre-B. ðŸŽˆ is a seamless payment app that lets users pay or transfer value using cCOP or other Mento stablecoins, while settling the transaction instantly over Colombia's Bre-B infrastructure. Allowing users top pay for goods and services in Colombia without having a bank account or going trough off ramp.

## Mission

Our mission is to make digital money truly usable in Colombia by connecting crypto with Bre-B. We aim to expand financial inclusion, simplify everyday payments, and give both users and merchants a fast, low-cost way to transact without barriers.

## Problem

Stablecoin holders face expensive, slow off-ramps just to spend their assets. Merchants rarely accept crypto because they need pesos, and existing payment rails don't bridge the gap. As a result, using digital assets for everyday goods and services is still clunky, costly, and out of reach for most people.

## Solution

Our app bridges crypto and Bre-B, letting anyone pay instantly in Colombia with cCOP or other stablecoins without needing a bank account. It removes costly off-ramps, gives merchants seamless peso settlement, and makes spending digital assets as simple as sending a Bre-B transfer.

## Key Technologies & Programs

### Bre-B

Bre-B is Colombia's immediate payment system, officially launched by the Banco de la RepÃºblica on July 14, 2025. It enables rapid, secure electronic transfers between individuals and businesses across different financial institutions and digital wallets. The system allows users to send money without registering a specific key, though receiving funds requires one. Transfers are capped at 11,552,000 COP per transaction, with individual institutions potentially setting lower limits for security purposes. Bre-B aims to streamline interbank transactions, reduce reliance on traditional payment methods, and enhance financial inclusion across Colombia.
